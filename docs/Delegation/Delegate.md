## Quick start - Delegate {#quick-start---delegate}

Razor network is a proof of stake network. In order to participate in the network as a delegator, you will need to "Delegate" your RAZORs. RAZOR is (`ERC20` token standard) the native token in Razor Network.

> Warning: Razor network is in alpha state and is deployed on Skale v2 Testnet. Please use Testnet tokens only.

## Metamask Setup {#metamask-setup}

1. Click on `Connect Wallet` on the official Razor Network client <https://razorscan.io/>.
2. Switch to the Skale Testnet Network and connect Metamask wallet.
3. Click on the `+` icon to add the RAZOR contract address.
4. Alternatively, contract addresses and network details can be found [here](http://localhost:3000/docs/incentivised-testnet/deployment-details) if you would like to verify the addresses manually.

### Step 3 {#step-3}

Click on the “Action” button next to the staker of your choice to delegate your RAZOR tokens to them. You can choose a staker based on activity, commission, stake, APR, age, etc.

**Note** - _Commission here refers to the percentage of the rewards earned on the delegated funds charged by the staker._

### Step 4 {#step-4}

Click on the Delegate action, you will be shown a modal with more information on the staker. Input the number of RAZOR tokens you want to delegate and click on “Approve & Delegate”.

**Note** - _Make sure the network is correct and the connected wallet has RAZOR and enough tokens for gas as required._
